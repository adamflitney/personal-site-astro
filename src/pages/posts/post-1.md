# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-01-13

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! I will share my learning journey as I build my new website.

## What I've accomplished so far

1. **Installed Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Made Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Made A Blog Post**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Atro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space!
