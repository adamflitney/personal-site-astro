      I'm an experienced senior full-stack software engineer with a passion for
      problem solving and personal development.

      I'm currently rebuilding my personal website using Astro. Ever since I saw
      astro being used on a learnWithJason youtube video, I've been enchanted by
      its simple yet powerful approach to web development.
